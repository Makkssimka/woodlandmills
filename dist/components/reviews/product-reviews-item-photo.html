        <p>I have over 120 hours on my HM126. It has been a great mill, but even better than the mill has been Woodland Millsâ€™ customer service. I have had a handful of warranty claims over the last two years and it has become very obvious that they are actively searching to build the best product that they can. I called them one day to help me figure out what was going on with my mill, and they helped me identify that I had hydroplaned my blade. When another company may have argued that it was operator error and they were not liable for any of the damages, Woodland Mills offered to send me a new blade and any parts that were damaged due to the blade hydroplaning.
            When sending me warranty parts, they have even included redesign parts that I didn't even ask about. You may be able to find a similarly priced mill on the market, but I challenge you to find one with a better customer service team backing it.
